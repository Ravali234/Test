### Local Install: Step-by-step guide

Demo_GUI is built on Python, so a recent version of the CPython 2.7.x interpreter is required
Demo_GUI also needs access to a number of scientific modules,
and the e≈asiest way to get an interpreter and the necessary modules is to install the Wpython distribution:

Python download & install:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/

-----------------------------------

Once you have installed Winpython, you can get ahold of Demo_GUI in two different ways:


Once you have `Demo_GUI.zip`, unzip it, open the folder,
and double click the provided install.bat. This script will use Python’s Preferred Installer Program (`pip`) and
easy to install the necessary Python packages.

To start the application with default configuration, just double click the included `start.bat`. \

This will run Demo_GUI in a command window and open a new tab in your default browser to Demo_GUI.

To close the application, close all open tabs and close the Demo_GUI command window.
